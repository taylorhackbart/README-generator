# MarkDown Generator (README.md)
Homework 7
## Description
This homework was to generate a README.md file from JavaScript files using Node. Once the user has the correct packages installed, they will run node index.js in their terminal and be prompted with questions that will append into their new readme file. 

## Usage 
To use this, you must run npm install, npm install inquirer and npm install path. Once this is complete, typing in "node index.js" will begin the prompted questions in your terminal.
